# Router Setup

This section refers to the network diagram shown below:

- Host A communicates with Host B by sending its destination MAC address to the router, rather than Host B's MAC address.
- The router disregards the MAC address but processes the destination IP address. It forwards the packet through the second switch, eventually reaching Host B.

## Network Design Overview

This setup demonstrates connectivity between two locations, California (CA) and New York (NY). The topology includes two PCs, two switches, and two routers, as shown below:

- The devices are interconnected using straight-through cables due to the long distance between CA and NY. The third option in Packet Tracerâ€™s cable selection menu is used.

## Steps to Connect the Devices

Use the ports specified in the diagram for guidance. Note that the ports are assigned for demonstration purposes and can be adjusted if necessary (e.g., `F0/#`, where `#` represents the port number).

1. Connect `PC1` to `Switch1` using ports `F0/0` (PC1) and `F0/2` (Switch1).
2. Connect `Switch1` to `Router CA` using ports `F0/1` (Switch1) and `F0/1` (Router CA).
3. Connect `PC2` to `Switch2` using ports `F0/0` (PC2) and `F0/2` (Switch2).
4. Connect `Switch2` to `Router NY` using ports `F0/0` (Switch2) and `F0/2` (Router NY).
5. Connect `Router CA` to `Router NY` using ports `G0/0` (Router CA) and `G0/0` (Router NY).

Refer to the following diagram for visual representation:

## Configuring PCs

Configure PCs within the network to ensure seamless communication and functionality. Refer the diagram for the IP addresses.

1. **Access PC1**: 
2. **Open Configuration**: 
3. **Select Interface**: 
   - Choose **FastEthernet0**.  
4. **Assign IPv4 Address**:  
   - **IPv4 Address**: `192.168.10.10`.  
   - **Subnet Mask** will be automatically filled.  
5. **Configure Default Gateway**:  
   - Navigate to **Settings** in the global options.  
   - **Default Gateway**: `192.168.10.1`.  
6. **Repeat for PC2** with `192.168.30.1` as the **Default Gateway**.  

## Configuring Routers

Configure the router for network functionality.

1. **Access the CA Router**: 
2. **Open CLI**: 
3. **Exit Initial Setup**: 
   - If prompted to enter the initial configuration dialog, type `no`.  
4. **Enter Privileged EXEC Mode**: 
   - `enable` 
5. **Enter Configuration Mode**:
   - `configure terminal` 
6. **Change Hostname of Router**:
   - `hostname CA`
7. **Change interface**:
   - `interface g0/1`
8. **Change IP address in the g0/1 interface**:
   - `ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0`
9. **Turn on router**: 
   - `no shutdown`
10. **Configure Additional Interfaces**:
   - Repeat steps 7-9 for `g0/0`.
11. **Configure NY Router**:
   - Repeat steps 1-10, make adjustments to IP addresses, and hostnames.
